      "Case Notes": "Natalee Holloway was an 18 year old, recently graduated high school student in 2005 when her senior class trip took her to Aruba.  When she failed to show up for her flight to go back home to Alabama on May 30th, authorities were alerted to her disappearance.  Initially, local authorities believed she was just a partying tourist that was probably somewhere sleeping off a hangover.  \n\nNatalee was last seen by her classmates getting into a car with local residents Joran van der Sloot and Deepak and Satish Kalpoe.  When later questioned, they said they had dropped Holloway off at her hotel and denied knowing what happened to her after that.  Van der Sloot was arrested twice and the Kalpoes were arrested three times each in connection to this case, but always were released without charges.  \n\nIn the years since Holloway's disappearance, van der Sloot has remained in the media spotlight.  Multiple times, he has gone on talk shows to tell the \"true story of what happened\" to Holloway in exchange for money - after which, he would claim he was lying during the shows / interviews.  He has given multiple confessions to the crime and multiple versions of his story, with his lies becoming more and more egregious, ranging from grinding up and burning her bones to selling her into sex slavery.  \n\n[In my opinion, the most likely events are:] van der Sloot and his friends the Kalpoes were known in their area to try to get with as many girls as they could.  They were known to use date rape drugs.  As a naive tourist on a party vacation, Holloway would have been a prime target for such men.  I think it is most likely that she takern to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach  and was drugged and raped by van der Sloot and the Kalpoes on the night of May 29th / early morning May 30th.  Something killed her, whether it was a drug overdose or a choking on her own vomit or being killed by one or all three men involved. Her body was then disposed of, possibly into the ocean where it would be very unlikely, if not impossible, to be found again. \n\nNatalee's remains have never been found, but van der Sloot and the Kalpoes have continued to be prime suspects - in particular van der Sloot, who was later found to have murdered Stephany Flores in Peru on May 30, 2010 (the five year anniversary of Holloway's disappearance). For this crime, he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 28 years of imprisonment. He remains in prison to this day for the murder of Flores. \n\nDue to how the justice system works in Aruba, the case technically remains unsolved and, without new evidence, is unlikely to be opened again.  Despite this, the perpetrators are almost certainly known."

Winds pushed the fire through Callignee, Koornalla, Traralgon South, and onwards towards Gormandale and Willung South.  As a result of this fire, 81200 acres of land were burned and 11 people were killed. Fire investigators strongly believed that arson was the cause of this particular fire, which was just one part of a larger series of fires in Victoria around this time. On February 12th, a former volunteer fireman by the name of Brendan Sokaluk was arrested in connection with the crime.  In April 2012, Sokaluk was convicted of 10 counts of arson causing death and sentenced to 17 years and 9 months of prison time.  "

      "Case Notes": "Leigh Leigh was a 14 year old girl who convinced her parents to let her attend a party on Nov 3, 1989.  When she didn't arrive at the scheduled meetup place that night by 11 pm, her step father began searching for her.  Her body was found the next day among the dunes of the beach at which the party had been located.  She had severe damage to her head and genitals.  She was disfigured beyond recognition.\n\nThe boys who attended the party (as well as their parents) closed ranks to protect themselves.  There was a strong culture of 'boys will be boys' and slut shaming and victim blaming.  \n\nThree males were of primary suspicion: a 15 year old boy who has not been named (\"Corey\") who openly admitted to raping Leigh and slut shaming her (despite Leigh being a virgin before the party).  The two \"adult supervisors\" at the party were 18-19 year old drunk males, Matthew Webster and  Guy Wilson, also admitted to assaulting her.  Rumors around the party indicated that many more had attacked Leigh, that she had been gang raped, but no one came forward with information.  The police and judges involved in the case all participated in the victim blaming culture.  No rape or assault terminology was used in the legal documents and the boys were treated as though the sexual interactions were consensual.  Matthew Webster eventually confessed to the murder (some speculate he did it to take sole blame and protect the others involved) and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.  He served 14 years, which was the minimum.  Guy Wilson served six months for assault, and \"Corey\" served 100 hours of community service.  Other parties that may have been involved have never been brought to justice.  \n\nLeigh and her family continued to be harrassed, victim blamed, and slut shamed by the people of Stockton.  "

      "Case Notes": "Dennis Nilsen was a gay man during a time when being gay was a criminal act. He had violent behaviors from a very young age, and this lead him to a career in the military.  After his time in the military and an argument with his family over gay rights (after which he never spoke to most of them again), he moved to London to work at the metropolitan police and, later, as a civil servant. As a big city, there were many different sorts of people to meet and Nilsen made use of gay bars to meet likeminded people.  He engaged in several relationships, but up to this point had not killed anyone (but had assaulted and taken advantage of several people throughout his life). In December 1978, he encountered 14 year old Stephen Holmes.  He lured Holmes back to Nilsen's home where he plied the boy with alcohol.  The next day, while Holmes slept, Nilsen strangled him and then drowned him in a bucket of water because he didn't want Holmes to leave.  He kept the body under the floorboards and would masterbate over the body.  This became Nilsen's usual method - to drug the desired victim, strangle them and drown them, and stow the body away to be used again for sexual needs later.  The bodies would eventually be cut to manageable pieces and destroyed in bonfires. While living in this particular home at Melrose avenue in London, Nilsen is suspected to have killed as many as 12 men between 1978 and 1981. Some of the victims have never been identified by name, so the exact number is not known.  But the method for most of the victims was the same.  \n\nIn 1982, Nilsen moved to a new home in Cranley Gardens.  He did not have access to a garden or floorboards at this some since he was renting an attic apartment, and so he needed new methods to dispose of his victims. He decided, instead of bonfires, he would dissect the bodies and dispose of the pieces down drain pipes.  This would end up being his undoing, since the flesh and bones would come to block the drains at Cranley Gardens and the remains would be discovered when plumbers came to fix the issue.  The pipe from whence the body parts had come from was clearly Nilsen's, and police were called to inspect the home.  The body of Nilsen's final victim, Stephen Sinclair, was found partially dissected in the home when the police arrived. Nilsen was arrested and confessed to the crimes.\n\nNilsen was brought to trial on October 24, 1984, charged with six counts of murder and two attempted murder (some potential victims had managed to run away).  Nilsen pleaded not guilty, and his solicitors focused on his state of mind before, during, and after the murders as his defense.  Testimony from some survivors was given, and helped the prosecution establish that Nilsen was in full control of himself when the attacks happened.  Some of the victims had refused to report their assaults to police at thetime due to fear of their sexuality being discovered.  Nilsen's confession was used by the prosecution  and the much of the evidence in the case came directly from the confessions.  An investigator noted how unusual it is for a defendent to go into such detail during their confessions.  After much testimony, the jury returned on November 3 with a verdict of guilty on six counts of murder and one attempted murder.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 25 years."

      "Case Notes": "Dalia Dippolito is a former sex worker who had a very quick runaway marriage with one of her clients, Michael Dippolito.  Michael had a history of drug addiction and abuse (and so had a criminal record), but was trying to stay clean and out of trouble with the law.  Shortly after their marriage, anonymous tips regarding his alleged drug use / drug trafficking were sent to their local police department, resulting in various raids from police.  He also had difficulty obtaining all the money he needed for some of his legal / parole issues thanks to Dalia.  While this was going on, Dalia was having an affair with a man named Mohamed Shihadeh.  She asked him to murder Michael to get him out of the way (or find someone in Shihadeh's gang that could do it).  He agreed, but then went to the police to report it. The police set up an operation where they sent in a cop to pretend to be a contract killer.  This cop struck a deal with Dalia, and the date for Michael's 'death' was set.  Dalia got out of the house for the arranged time, and then cops contacted her to come home because there had been an incident with her husband and he was now dead.  The cops used this situation to get plenty of Dalia's statements and lies recorded on video.  It was later revealed to her that Michael was alive and well, and she was being charged with murder for hire.    Dalia faced three trials.  Her first in 2011 resulted in a conviction and a 20 year sentenced, but the conviction was tossed out by an appeals court judge in 2014 due to improper jury selection.  Her second trial in 2016 ended in a hung jury. Her trial trial in 2017 ended in a guilty verdict with a sentence of 16 years in prison. She has since appealed this conviction, but her appeals have so far been rejected. "

      "Case Notes": "Brittany Phillips was a college student in Tulsa, OK.  After her classes finished on September 27th, she returned to her apartment.  None of her friends or family heard from her for several days, so a friend went to her apartment to check on her.  Her body was discovered and she likely was killed between 9 pm September 27th and 8 am of the following day.  She had been sexually assaulted and then strangled / suffocated to death.\n\nThere were no signs of her apartment being broken into, so it is possible that she knew her attacker and let him in.  But it was later discovered that her apartment could be accessed via a small door in her closet which led to the attic - an attic that was shared between seven apartments. Thus anyone who had access to any of those apartments would have had access to Brittany's.  DNA and fingerprints were taken from the scene, but unfortunately they have not led anywhere in the case.  Some other items from the crime scene - in particular, a pillowcase - are believed to have possibly belonged to the perpetrator, but it is not known for sure.  The case almost recieved a breakthrough when a DNA sample from the apartment was matched to a man, but this man was found to have been a friend of Maggie's.  He had an alibi and the police did not charge him with any involvement.  \n\nThe case went cold and Brittany's mother, Maggie, has crusaded since to keep her daughter's name in the public eye.  She travels the country with a car she had painted with her daughter's image and a sign \"Caravan to Catch a Killer\".  She has tried to get some media outlets to give Brittany's case air time, but she has been rejected - with one telling her that her daughter's murder was \"too boring\" to put on TV.  Brittany's case remains unsolved. "

      "Case Notes": "In 1991, Julie Dart was an 18 year old girl who had started working as a sex worker. On July 9 of that year, she was kidnapped by Michael Sams, imprisoned her in a coffin-like box, and held for ransom.  Sams contacted police several times, threatening to firebomb a local store if he wasn't given ransom money.  None of the communications came to any fruition, however, and Julie's body was found nine days later.  Sams later confessed that she had attempted to escape and psychologists beleive Sams had always intended to kill her. \n\nOn January 22, 1992, 25 year old estate agent Stephanie Slater was kidnapped by Sams and held in a cramped coffin-like box for eight days.  Sams continued to demand ransoms, similarly as he had done for Julie Dart.  Unlike Dart, Slater did not attempt to escape and largely played along with Sams.  Sams later released Slater back to her family.  Stephanie later admitted that Sams had raped her during her imprisonment.\n\nAt this point in time, police had no clue who the suspect was.  The case was higlighted on the tv show Crimewatch, where Sams' ex wife recognized his wife and several details about the perpetrator.  She and her son reported Sams to the police. This tip-off led Sams to be arrested and subsequently brought to trial.  He accepted responsibility for kidnapping the women, but claimed an unnamed accomplice had murdered Dart.  He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.  Three days after being imprisoned, he confessed to the murder as well.  \n\nOfficials credit Slater's smart actions and presence of mind during her imprisonment for her survival and aiding police in apprehending the perpetrator.

      "Case Notes": "A notorious unsolved case from Japan.  During new years, 2000-2001, a stranger broke into the home of the Miyazawa family (via removing a screen in a second floor bathroom) and murdered all four family members one by one.  First, 6 year old Rei was strangled and 8 year old Niina was injured.  Niina retreated to her mother, 41 year old Yasuko.  Mikio heard the disturbance and went to Rei's room to discover what happened. The intruder used a knife to murder 44 year old Mikio so brutally that the knife broke, and then attacked Niina and Yasuko again using a Santoku knife from the kitchen. \n\nOnce all four family members were dead, the killer stayed in the home for some hours (between 2 to 10).  They used the family computer, ate food, used the bathroom, used first aid kits on his injuries, and took a nap.  Later analysis of the computer showed that after the murders, at 1:18 am and 10:00 am, the computer had been used to connect to the internet. Based off this information, investigators know the killer stayed in the home until at least 1:18 am, but potentially until 10:00 am (though this instance could have been triggered by Yasuko's mother coming over to the home after all her calls to the house had gone unanswered).  Oddly enough, the killer attempted to purchase theater tickets on the computer.\n\nThis case is highly unusual in that the killer left behind so much evidence, but has yet to have been found.  The killer's feces were found in an unflushed toilet.  The killer left behind clothing items (in particular a sweater bought in the Kanagawa prefecture that had only sold 130 of its kind).  Trace amounts of sand in a bag left behind by the killer was traced to the Nevada desert near Edwards Air Force Base in California, USA.  DNA and fingerprints for the killer were found in the home, but so far have not been connected to any known person (so they potentially do not have a criminal record). The killer's blood was also discovered (type A, which no member of the Miyazawa family had that type).  The killer is thus known to be male and potentially mixed race.  Furthermore, the police estimate that the killer was born between 1965-1985, 170 cm tall, and thin, based on the physicality one would need to enter the home as the killer did.  Based off the wounds, he is likely right handed.\n\nThe case remains active but still with no real leads even 20 years later."

Their child (Qian Xun Xue), who was nicknamed Pumpkin for the clothing brand she was wearing, was found and taken into emergency foster care while the case continued.  A couple of days later, police identified Pumpkin's parents as New Zealanders and found Anan's body when they went to their home.  The hunt for Nai Yin Xue became international since he had fled to the US and was seen in various states, from California, to Texas, to Alabama, and more.

Grant claimed the girls had been driving despite his long record of drunk driving and the fact that he had had more than 30 drinks leading up to the crash.  Prior to his trial, the charge of  indecent interference with a corpse was dropped. Grant's lawyer was paid for by an anonymous benefactor, and the all-white jury acquitted him for culpable driving.  There has not been any justice for Cindy and Mona even 30 years on.  Grant died in 2017 without ever having spent a day in jail as a result of the girl's deaths or the molestation of Cindy."

Ultimately, the husband was acquitted due to some errors in the testimony of the abductors (and the fact that Mngeni died in prison, so he could no longer actively testify about the case).  Zola Tongo was found guilty and sentenced to 18 years in prison. Qwabe was sentenced to 25 years in prison.  Mngeni was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison, but he died in prison in 2014.

      "Case Notes": "7 year old Steven Stayner was kidnapped on his way home from school in 1972.  Police, family, and the community could find no trace of his whereabouts despite ongoing searches and police work for years.  Steven was actually alive the whole time and had been kidnapped by a child sex predator, Kenneth Parnell, who had previous run-ins with the law over child sex abuse. Parnell claimed he wanted a boy to raise as his own and have his own family, but he was sexually abusing Steven on a near daily basis when he was small (less often as he his his teen years).  When Steven hit puberty, he was no longer to Parnell's taste and so Parnell went in search for another little boy to kidnap.  He successfully kidnapped 5 year old Timmy White from Ukiah, CA.  Steven did not want Timmy to experience what he had experienced, so he started to plan a way to get TImmy back to his family.  A few weeks after Timmy's kidnapping, Steven managed it - he managed to get them to the police department while Parnell was at his night shift job.  By this point, Steven had lost some memory of who he was originally due to Parnell threatening him over it, but knew his first name and (maybe) his last name. He was able to piece together the story for police.  \n\nPolice and legal team at the time did not take the sexual abuse of Steven seriously, in part due to the length of time since he was originally taken and in part due to a culture of not taking child sex crimes seriously. Steven's mormon parents also refuse to acknowledge his sexual abuse and refused to get him therapy or any sort of help for it.  He was bullied at school for \"being gay\" when he was actually a sexual assault victim. Steven testified at Parnell's trial in 1981, and Parnell was sentenced to five yeas imprisonment (and was paroled after two years). Parnell would go on to try to kidnap another boy later on, which would result in a life imprisonment sentence.  \n\nAfter the trial, Steven had a hard time adjusting back to normal life and fell into drugs and alcohol, which his strict mormon parents did not approve of.  After he almost OD'd, he decided to quit drugs and alcohol altogether. He married his wife in 1985 and had two children with her.  In 1989, he died when a (probably drunk) driver hit his motorcycle.  \n\nTimmy White went on to lead a happy (but short) life. He became a deputy of the LA sheriff's department and gave talks and lectures about his experience as a kidnap victim.  He died in 2010 from a pulmonary embolism."

She had been hanging out at a bar that evening with an acquaintance Denson White.  She was not seen again after leaving that bar (presumably with White or following him in her car).  Denson had her cell phone with him the following days and eventually returned it to Danniella's friend Julie, who reported her missing.  Denson had called Danniella and left several messages on her phone  via facebook messenger (despite that he had her phone with him).  Police did not seem to have a very good investigation in this case, as they bungled several key pieces of evidence (such as claiming no CCTV video footage existed of Danniella that night with Denson, but there was).  Danniella remained missing until May 2019, when her body was found submerged inside her car in a bayou ~20 miles from where she had last been.  \n\nThe case is technically unsolved at this point, but circumstantial evidence points to Denson White as a suspect.

      "Case Notes": "A call came in to the Mount Washington, KY, McDonalds in April 2004 from a man claiming to be a police officer.  He stated that one of the employees - a young, slim girl - had stolen from a customer and she would have to be searched.  The Assistant Manager at the time, Donna Summers, identified this thief as 18 year old part time worker, Louise Ogborn.  She was placed into the McDonald's office. Since Donna was too busy to watch over Louise or follow the instructions of the \"officer' herself, she brought her fiance (Walter Nix) to conduct the interview and watch over Louise on the \"officer's\" behalf.  Over the next ~3 hours, this supposed police officer gave instructions under the guise of interviewing and investigating this thievery.  Louise was stripped naked, with only a very small apron to partly cover her body.  Her body was described to the officer over the phone.  Her bodily cavities were 'searched' for the stolen items. She was sexually assaulted by Nix, all at the behest of this police officer.  Each time Summers would come to the office, Louise would beg to be let go, but Summers refused.  After assaulting Louise, Nix left and Summers had to find a replacement to watch over Louise.  She asked Thomas Simms, the maintenance man, to watch over Louise.  The officer tried to get Simms to continue with Louise's \"interogation\" / assault, but Simms knew this situation wasn't quite right.  He refused to go along with the demands and informed Summers of the disgusting demands the cop had made.  Only then did Summers suspect that perhaps this cop wasn't really a cop.  Louise was let go and real police brought in to investigate.  Louise's full assault was caught on the CCTV of the office.\n\nThis was just the latest in a series of scams that had been occurring at various fast food restaurants since the early 1990s.  Investigators of another similar scam had been able to connect the phone caller with a pre-paid phone card.  Comparing the footage between different scam events (and stores where the cards had been bought) led officers to 36 year old David Stewart, a married police-wanna-be with five children.  They got a warrant to search his home where they found another pre paid phone card that was linked to several of these fast food scams (but not the one in Mount Washington).  \n\nStewart was put on trial, but ultimately was found not guilty since the one phone card found at his residence wasn't the one directly used in the Mount Washington situation.  However, from the moment Stewart was arrested for the crimes, there has not been any other such scam perpetuated.\n\nLouise also sued McDonald's for their role in the event.  The scam had been a well known issue, but McDonald's did nothing to inform or train their employees of it or how to respond to it.  McDonald's legal team went so far as to argue that Louise's assault was her own fault and she had \"grown stronger\" by experiencing it.  McDonald's ultimately was found responsible and Louise was  awarded a settlement over $6 million dollars.  McDonalds would go on to appeal and eventually would settle out of court with Louise for an undisclosed amount."

She stole identities from multiple people throughout a number of US states and England.  In 1990, she murdered her only known murder victim - Beverly McGowan, a 34 year old woman seeking a roomate to help pay her condo mortgage.  The trail of McGowan's death went cold for over a decade until authorities were able to identify Elaine Parent as connected to several people who had committed crimes in the country - who all turned out to be Elaine herself.  When finally confronted by police in April 2002, Elaine shot herself before she could be arrested.  She has gone on to be known as the Chameleon Killer due to her numerous disguises and aliases.

      "Case Notes": "Cary Stayner, older brother of kidnapping victim Steven Stayner, first felt the impulse to murder at seven years of age.  He finally acted on his impulse in 1999 when he worked as a maintenance man for a hotel in Yosemite National Park.  His victims were victims of opportunity, killed in two batches: Carole, Juli, and Silvinia were family/friends travelling together and Cary killed them in February of that year. He was not suspected of the crimes at the time.  His next opportunity was in July of that year, when he came across Joie along working outside her cabin.  Cary became the obvious suspect at this point in time - his fingerprints and shoe prints were all over the crime scenes.  Cary was arrested and confessed to everything.  At his trial in 2002, Cary was convicted of four counts of first degree murder  and sentenced to death.  He remains on death row to this day."
